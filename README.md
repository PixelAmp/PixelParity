# Pixel Parity!
The purpose of this program is to copy the contents of a local folder into a remote server.

This is effectivley a home-made duct-tape version of google drive.

The main use for this proh=ject is to allow me to develop a script on an IDE on my PC, the be able to test it on my Raspberry pi without having to manually move the files. 

Send me a message if you have any suggestions for making this tool more useful!
